     <h1>Foundations of Web Development: Lesson 1</h1>
     <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>This page will cover:</p>
     <ul>
      <li> HTML</li>
      <li> CSS </li>
      <li> How they work together ;)</li>
      <li> Boiler plates and how to get your page online</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
     <p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is how the majority of content on the internet is built.  It acts as the building blocks of a webpage, telling a browser how to structure plain text. Behind most websites is a HTML document that tells the browser what information to display and how to display it.</p>
     <h3> HTML code is made up of:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li> Elements</li>
      <li> Tags </li>
      <li> Attributes </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Tags (e.g. a paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;) and their attributes (e.g. a style attribute) make up an HTML element, which forms part of the HTML document.</p>
     <h3>HTML documents must contain:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>A doctype declaration</li>
      <li>A html tag</li>
      <li>A head tag (contains page name, metadata, etc)</li>
      <li>A body tag (the info we see on a page)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
     <p>HTML by itself looks pretty boring. CSS (cascading style sheets) is used to change the appearance of a page.</p>
     <h3> CSS can determine:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Colour</li>
      <li>Size</li>
      <li>Font</li>
      <li>And more</li>
     </ul>
     <p>CSS rules consist of a selector (the HTML tag e.g. &lt;p&gt;), a property (e.g. color) and a value (e.g. red)</p>
     <h3>CSS rules can be applied to a HTML document in three ways:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>In-line CSS (targeting a specific HTML tag)</li>
      <li>Internal CSS (in the head section of a HTML document)</li>
      <li>External CSS (linked in the head section of an HTML document - this is the most common way for websites as it can be easily applied to multiple pages)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>How do they work together?</h2>
     <p>This page has been built using HTML and CSS.  In Chrome, if you right click anywhere on this page and select "Inspect" you can open up the developer tab and take a closer look at how it has been built. Look at the page and the HTML side-by-side.</p>
     <p>An external CSS sheet has been used to define a number of elements, including headings, links, paragraphs and lists.  This page is a simple example - you can see more complex examples all over the internet, including <a href="https://www.redcross.org.au/stories/2024/110/australia-turns-red-for-red-cross/">this article on the Red Cross Website</a>. Pages like this won't have been handcoded, but are still good to look at. You may have to dig a little through the code - try expanding &lt;div&gt; tags in the body.</p>
